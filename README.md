- Fixed `Web app manifest should contain valid JSON` issue
- Added embed image

## 26/04/2023
- Forgot to change some info in `Head.astro`
- Changed the background colour to my discord colours
- Allowed users to scroll down in case they are using a small device
  - However, this allows the user to scroll down on large devices, when it's not needed. I'll fix this
